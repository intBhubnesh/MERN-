## JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only. JSON is a light weight data format for storing and transporting. JSON is mostly used when data is sent from a server to a client. JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML.

```js
{
"users":[
  {
    "firstName":"Bhubnesh",
    "lastName":"Maharana",
    "age":24,
    "email":"asab@asb.com"
  },
  {
    "firstName":"Alex",
    "lastName":"James",
    "age":25,
    "email":"alex@alex.com"
  },
  {
  "firstName":"Lidiya",
  "lastName":"Tekle",
  "age":28,
  "email":"lidiya@lidiya.com"
  }
]
}
```

### Difference between js object and JSON 
The difference is the key of a JSON object should be with double quotes or it should be a string. JavaScript Object and JSON are very similar that we can change JSON to Object and Object to JSON.

1. The JSON values can only be one of the six datatypes (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, Boolean, null). 
JavaScript objects on the other hand can be any valid JavaScript Structure.

JSON - is always in string format 
object - it can have diffrent formats
