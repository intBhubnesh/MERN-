## Java Script  
Java script was introduced as a web scripting laguage, and standardised as ECMA script 
As the browser have v8 engine provides the js runtime enviroment. 
Then Introducion of the NODE(which provide a run time enviroment in local machines), changed the game 


### Introduction to node js
Node provide run time enviroment for the javascript. 
Compile the code on the server-side.
now we no loager need browser to execute js code 

### Evolution of js as a programming language 
now due to node js can be used for all sort of programming work 

### what is difference between .txt and .js file 
.txt - store only text  
.js - store text as instructions 
**when we inject a .js file into compile we will get a output or error if js rules are not followed 
but, for .txt cant be inject to comile in the first place 

### Features of JS
- Prototype based : Relies on prototypes than on ojects 
- Multi-paradim : support multiple programming paradims 
                    Object oriented 
                    Functional Programing 
                    Procedural Programing 
                    Asyncronus Programming 
                    Event-Driven Programming Language 
- Single threaded : Dont support multi threading 
- Dynamic Language : memory allocation on the runtime
- Object Oriented : use of class to organise the code 
- Imperative : tell compiler how to do the work 
- Declarative : use the abstract function to get the output 


# Let's move to next part of js, where we will learn the basics of js programming language
